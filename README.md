# PDF-files-to-audio-MP3
Create a script to convert text from a PDF file into an MP3 audio file.

Script requirements:

1. When running the script, the user should be prompted to enter the path to the PDF file and select a language for the audio file (for example, 'en' or 'ru').
2. Upon successful execution of the script, the created audio file (MP3 format) should be saved in the same directory as the original PDF file, with the same file name but with a ".mp3" extension.
3. In case of errors (for example, incorrect file path, incorrect file extension), the script should inform the user about the problem.
